## Understanding Your Numbers

### Life Path Number
Your Life Path reveals your life's purpose and the journey you're meant to take. It's calculated from your birth date and shows your natural talents, challenges, and lessons.

### Expression Number (Destiny Number)
Your Expression Number reveals your natural abilities and life goals. Calculated from your full birth name, it shows what you're meant to accomplish and the talents you possess.

### Soul Urge Number (Heart's Desire)
Your Soul Urge Number shows your inner motivations and deepest desires. Calculated from the vowels in your name, it reveals what truly drives you from within.

### Personality Number
Your Personality Number reveals how others see you and the impression you make. Calculated from the consonants in your name, it shows your outer personality and style.

### Planes of Expression
The Planes of Expression reveal how you experience life through four different levels: Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Intuitive. Each plane shows how you perceive and process information through different faculties of your being.

#### Letter Classifications
Letters are classified into three categories based on their characteristics:
- **Creative**: E (Physical), A (Mental), I O R Z (Emotional), K (Intuitive)
- **Vacillating**: W (Physical), H J N P (Mental), B S T X (Emotional), F Q U Y (Intuitive)
- **Grounded**: D M (Physical), G L (Mental), C V (Intuitive)

*Note: No letters are both grounded and emotional. All vowels are creative except U, which is vacillating.*

#### Physical Plane Number
Your Physical Plane Number describes how you experience the physical world through your body - touch, taste, pleasure, and pain. It reveals your physical constitution, energy levels, and how you interact with the material world.

#### Mental Plane Number
Your Mental Plane Number describes how you think and process information. It reveals your learning style, logic patterns, and mental approach to life. This plane deals with the world of thought and invisible mental processes.

#### Emotional Plane Number
Your Emotional Plane Number reveals how you process feelings and emotions. It shows your emotional makeup, how you handle relationships, and your capacity for empathy and compassion. The heart is preoccupied exclusively with the world of emotion.

#### Intuitive Plane Number
Your Intuitive Plane Number describes your capacity for direct spiritual contact and higher perception. Intuitive insight comes in flashes, bypassing rational thought. This plane represents your ability to access higher realms of knowledge and understanding.
