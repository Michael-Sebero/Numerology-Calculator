Your Life Path reveals your life's purpose and the journey you're meant to take. It's calculated from your birth date and shows your natural talents, challenges, and lessons.

### Expression Number (Destiny Number)
Your Expression Number reveals your natural abilities and life goals. Calculated from your full birth name, it shows what you're meant to accomplish and the talents you possess.

### Soul Urge Number (Heart's Desire)
Your Soul Urge Number shows your inner motivations and deepest desires. Calculated from the vowels in your name, it reveals what truly drives you from within.

### Personality Number
Your Personality Number reveals how others see you and the impression you make. Calculated from the consonants in your name, it shows your outer personality and style.

### Planes of Expression
The Planes of Expression reveal how you experience life through four different levels: Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Intuitive. Each plane shows how you perceive and process information through different faculties of your being.

#### Letter Classifications
Letters are classified into three categories based on their characteristics:

*Note: No letters are both grounded and emotional. All vowels are creative except U, which is vacillating.*
